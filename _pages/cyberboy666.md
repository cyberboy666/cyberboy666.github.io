# cyberboy666

_cyberboy666 & user43368831 presents_ is an umbrella label for the various art & craft projects of Tim Caldwell


My interests include experimental video-art and live video performances, DIY electronics and upcycling obsolete consumer equipment, outsider film making and cult film curating, DIY event organizing and community spaces.

primarily the _cyberboy666_ pseudonym applies to my experimental video-art project created to explore ecstasy, confusion and decay through lo-fi DIY circuits, discarded VHS and misused video hardware.
