## About

cyberboy666 & user43368831 is an experimental video-art project created to explore ecstasy, confusion and decay through lo-fi DIY circuits, discarded VHS and misused video hardware. By salvaging and hoarding obsolete video equipment I pass time creating canvases to bend, glitch, distort and deconstruct visual stimulation.
