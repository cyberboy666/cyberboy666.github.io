# [Polyphase Portal](https://polyphaseportal.xyz)

Polyphase Portal is a new _media-art collective and educational online space_

together with some friends, organizers and educators we are creating a new online space to host educational programmes such as talks, live-streams, workshops and multi-week courses. taking encouragement from the success of [PHASE SPACE](https://phasespace.nyc/) in NYC we are aiming to facilitate accessible non-hierarchical learning over open and ethical technology â€“ find out more at [polyphaseportal.xyz](https://polyphaseportal.xyz) & join the [polyphase mailing list](https://polyphaseportal.xyz/mailing-list/) to stay in the loop!

to facilitate learning we will be running our own virtual classroom server - [rooms.polyphaseportal.xyz](https://rooms.polyphaseportal.xyz) - powered by a custom instance of [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/)

we will also be running the polyphase chatroom - [matrix.polyphaseportal.xyz](https://matrix.polyphaseportal.xyz) - powered by [matrix chat](https://matrix.org/) and a [wiki](https://wiki.polyphaseportal.xyz) - powered by [bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)
