TRASHPALACE is a weekly film club thats been running intermittently since aprox 2014. the format is usually to watch together every week a feature film preceeded by some trailers and occasional shorts. in addition we have had a range of special events including guest curators, double-features, secret screenings, open-airs, alternative-formats and an annual 12hr movie marathon!
