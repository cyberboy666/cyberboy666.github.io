TRASHPALACE is a meetup to celebrate trash, camp, cult, surreal, bizarre, incredibly strange, outsider, experimental, avant-garde, exploitation and genre cinema.

## TRASHPALACE2017

in 2017 we hosted weekly screenings from february through to december. 

each screening started with a 30min WARMUP film, usually ambient/background vibes (sometimes with the soundtrack or atmospheric background music) while people arrived and got settled. this was followed by lights out, a trailer reel and then the FEATURE PRESENTATION

we sometimes showed short films before the feature, a few double features were thrown in the mix for special occasions and one all-night marathon to get us through the winter.

i have archived each screening here along with promo text and images from the TRASHPALACE facebook group. although the text is my own (unless in quotes), some copy/paste phrases from online reviews was necessary to capture and hype films i hadnt seen - thank you if your words helped me share these awesome films.
