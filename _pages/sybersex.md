# SYB3RS3X

a reluctant union of magnetic tape and deejay culture

## background

i have had separate interests in both cassette tapes and dance music. somewhere wires crossed and the question (gimmick) lingered :

 _how and why would one go about performing a cassette tape deejay set ?_

cassette tapes and cassette players are obsolete and can easily be thrifted / salvaged

i already had a collection of old dance music on cassette, plus a number of local producers are now releasing their music on tape 

subsets of deejay culture already value physical sound storage / manual techniques (vinyl, turntables etc) over its convenient digital alternative (cdj's)

i value the quality of a djs selection over the quality of their gear. take every thing to its logical extreme. i rescued an extremely cheep 2-channel mixer and set it up with two portable top-loading cassette players. this was aesthetically pleasing / reminiscent of a real turntable set-up

## modifications and techniques

this is a woefully neglected work in progress. i hope to put some time into it soon

### vary cassette playback speed for beat matching

### 'touch' control over cassette gear for beat sync

### bmp recognition and visual beat matching aid ???

## essay on cassette-tape-deejaying

i want to elaborate and articulate further why this is an interesting intersection. drawing on history of cassette culture : examples of cassettes as a diy distribution, introducing dance music to soviet union, impact of accessible, rewritable sound storage. dj origins in misusing audio equipment, dance musics contribution to mixing , sampling , remixing , producing. my own exploration of modifying hardware for low-fi mixing.

## original SYB3RS3X dance releases

i have had little time for experimenting with creating dance music lately although hope to soon.

a rough demo track can be heard here:
