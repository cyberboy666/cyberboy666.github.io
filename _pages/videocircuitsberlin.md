# Video Circuits Berlin

VCB is a community meet-up for anyone in Berlin interested or curious about video circuitry, synthesis, visual coding, DIY electronics and tools. Gilbert Sinnott ([autr](https://autr.tv)) and I started orginising some events in 2019 - usually the format was a casual meet-up - a few talks or performances planned but mainly just a place to hang out and talk shop - we also had "open decks" where people could contribute to and play around on various video instruments. we were lucky to be able to host events out of [Lacuna Labs](https://lacunalab.org/) (sadly no longer possible since realtors closed in and decided to kick out all the artists, and jack up the rents)

since i left Berlin in early 2021 Gilbert and some others have continued to organised events - we even did some diy soldering workshops, a meet-up and a garten party when i was back in town summer 2022!

theres a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/video-circuits-berlin) here and meet-up notes and photos also archived [here](https://github.com/autr/video-circuits-berlin)
