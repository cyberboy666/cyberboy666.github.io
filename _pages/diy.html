	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>I became interested in creating analogue video art last year and started experimenting with some diy projects. I am indebted to the wealth of insight and information already available online (a selection of my favourite resources can be found here) but as a complete amateur with no experience in video or electronics, found the learning curve quite steep. Video circuits are difficult (and sometimes dangerous) but I believe with enough detail, schematics and examples anyone can take the plunge. I am still learning and can by no means tell you the definitive way to build anything. A huge part of the fun is experimenting and learning from trying. This site aims to document the success and failures I have had so far; loosely ordered by difficulty, give some insight into the risks (if any) involved and hopefully inspire someone to break video.</p>
