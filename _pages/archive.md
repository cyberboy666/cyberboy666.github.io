## Introduction

From salvaging e-waste, thrifting dumpstores and lurking local auction sites I have  acquired some interesting consumer-level video mixers, titlers and other oddities. By taking time to document not just the different specs, but also their subtle quirks and misbehaviours, I hope to catalogue a slice of dead media that showcases the potential for repurposed video-art and captures some of the personality in each retired machine. I have also had the pleasure of assembling some beautiful video-circuit kits created by active artists which I will document and showcase here.
