## Introduction

From salvaging e-waste, thrifting dumpstores and lurking local auction sites I have  acquired some interesting consumer-level video mixers, titlers and other oddities.
Living in New Zealand it often feels like fishing in a small pond (compared to what seems to be available on larger continents). However I have also noticed little competition on these items when they do surface (so maybe a small pond which occasionally traps a big fish no one knows how to cook?)

Given these circumstances (and to justify my unhealthy obsession with collecting junk) I will use this section to write love letters to all the video mixers cluttering my flats hallway.
By taking time to document not just the different specs, but also their subtle quirks and misbehaviours, I hope to catalogue a slice of dead media that showcases the potential for repurposed video-art and captures some of the personality in each retired machine.

I have also had the pleasure of assembling some beautiful video-circuit kits created by active artists/creators which I also plan to document and showcase here.
