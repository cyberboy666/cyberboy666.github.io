## Introduction

Endeavouring to help other amateurs like me take their first diy video steps, I have selected a number of cheap beginner projects (loosely ordered by difficulty) to meticulously document here. I am still learning and can by no means tell you the definitive way to build anything. A huge part of the fun is experimenting - by recording my thoughts, successes and failures I only hope to inspire some others to break video.

 (SPOILER: circuit bending most video artefacts is dangerous. Do not attempt these if you are not aware/comfortable with the risks involved - there are plenty of other safe projects to try!)
