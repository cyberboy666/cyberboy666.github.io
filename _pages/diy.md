## Introduction

 I became interested in creating diy video tools early this year and quickly found a supportive online community with a wealth of knowledge on the subject. In spite of this, as a complete amateur with little experience in video or electronics, I struggled to find inspiration to get started. Endeavouring to help others like me take that first step I have presented a number of cheap beginner projects (loosely ordered by difficulty) to meticulously document here. I am still learning and can by no means tell you the definitive way to build anything. A huge part of the fun is experimenting - by recording my thoughts, successes and failures I only hope to inspire others to break video.

 (SPOILER: circuit bending most video artefacts is dangerous - do not attempt these if you are not aware/comfortable with the risks involved - there are plenty of other safe projects to try!)
