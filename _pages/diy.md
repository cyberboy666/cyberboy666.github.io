## projects

this (fairly large) [r_e_c_u_r] project has dominated my spare time lately, leaving a bunch of others in transit. hopefully i will get around to completing some soon.

### projects [WORKS IN PROGRESS]

note: WIP project logs may be less concise than their completed equivalent...

- building an [x0xb0x] diy bass synth with custom 3d printed case and mods
- building a [midi splitter], probably in eurorack compatible format
- building a variable bench [dc power supply]
- rebuilding [cyberboy666.com] ; a static website to host my projects, documentation and art portfolio
- mod my [volca beets]
- mod a small toy keyboard to be a [midi controller]
- new version of a [VGA video synth]


### future projects

- mod my dr-110 and tr-626 drum machines
- investigate [eurorack] as a hardware standard, document experiments / write about findings
