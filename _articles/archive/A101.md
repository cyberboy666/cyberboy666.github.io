# {{ page.title }}

Heres where I will write some information about this video mixer. 
I will probably talk mainly about the different effects and features that it has, include some pictures of it
maybe i will want to use lists:
- still
- strobe
- paint
- mosaic

or maybe sometimes tables would be better:

| Feature | AVE-5 | MX10 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| has keying | / | x |
| has colours | / | / |

## Mixer Feedback

one of the main points of difference between consumer video mixers is their internal mixer feedback. I probably will talk about these and show a video.
