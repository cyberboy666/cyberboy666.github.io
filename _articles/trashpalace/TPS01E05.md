Dario Argento popularized Giallo (transgressive Italian thriller/horror genre films containing elements of mystery and eroticism) for international audiences. These 'proto-slashers' had significant influence on John Carpenter's Halloween, kickstarting the american slasher movement. Anyone who has seen Suspiria (1977) should have some idea of what we are in for! Italian progressive rock band Goblin creates memorable atmospheric soundtracks for both Suspira and Deep Red. With his visual flair, crawling cameras and progressive soundtracks, Dario Argento sets the perfect mood for the on-slaughter of blood, screams and elaborately violent murders.
