around december each year we make the pilgrimage to aucklands hollywood theatre for the incredibly strange [24-hour movie marathon].

as winter sets in, teetering on six months since the last procession, even our weekly wednesday penance won't atone us. join me for a service through the darkest hours. welcome to BLACKMASS

## LINEUP

all the films played unannounced. in hindsight the programming wasnt quite as aggressive as i made out (probably less than ~4 hours of filth), but it's good to set expectations low...
