_Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, its a Rock Alien!_

Aliens land in the mythical town of “Speelburgh, U.S.A” searching for the source of rock & roll. What they find is a gang of teenagers, led by Dee Dee and Frankie, along with Frankie’s posse/rock band, the Pack. The leader of the aliens takes a shine to Dee Dee and all sorts of trouble breaks out.
