## [TRASHPALACE S03E11]({{page.url}})

This Doco looks into lives and relationship of the free-spirited, groundbreaking pioneers of video art Steina and Woody Vasulka. After meeting in Prague in the early 1960s, they relocated from Czechoslovakia to New York, where they founded The Kitchen, their legendary art and performance gallery. Now in later life, mostly forgotten by the contemporary art scene, they struggle to archive their vast body of work.
