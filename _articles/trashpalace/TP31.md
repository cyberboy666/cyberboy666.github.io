** LIVE CINEMA! **
[WEMAKEPORN] performs an original score to the 1933 experimental film LOT IN SODOM (30mins)

James Bidgood's PINK NARCISSUS complements this with more NYC-arthouse-homoeroticism. a grainy pink window into the erotic fantasies of a gay male prostitute, a visual ode to the male form, "draping in finery, stripping them and gazing upon them in repose, in pleasure, in ecstasy, in pain, always finding their aesthetics rather than their anatomies"
