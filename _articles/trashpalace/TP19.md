thanks nziff! (we took a break for the duration of the NewZealand International FilmFestival) but anyone else notice the lack of giant flying stone heads and future Sean Connery in knee-high-leather-boots-and-a-red-nappy? luckily TRASHPALACE is back to satisfy exactly this craving. After the success of Deliverance, director John Boorman essentially had the freedom (and budget) to make whatever he wanted... and what a bizarre, confusing, erotic and immortal vision it turned out to be!
