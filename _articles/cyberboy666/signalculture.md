## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

it so happened that my plans to travel outside nz coincided with an invitation to spend some time working on my r_e_c_u_r project at [Signal Culture] in Owego, New York. This was an amazing experience which i want to write about in more detail soon. In short i used this opportunity to explore and push the limits of what a raspberry pi based video instrument could do. there is a more [detailed write-up] on this research on the github. Hopefully these new features will make it to a stable release soon !
