## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

[Vidicon](https://vidicon.org/) is a gathering of video artists, analog, digital, software, hardware and everything in between. For 3-4 days there is never ending sessions of jams, talks, workshops, impromptu art pieces, collaborations and performances.

[scanlines.xyz](https://scanlines.xyz) provided infrastructure to help power this festival, so i was busy in the background settings things up. Itâ€™s so rewarding to see it all come together - thanks [ed](https://www.instagram.com/edwerk/) and everyone involved
