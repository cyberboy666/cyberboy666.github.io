## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

was such a pleasure to work with the DOJO CREW to design and realize their __recycled tv wall installation__ for [Twisted Frequency Festival 23/24](https://twistedfrequency.nz/) - we used 8 rescued tvs & monitors (from wellington tip shop) , a hardware tv_wall_controller and some custom mapping software i wrote to achieve the synchronized tv wall effect shown below. this went on to become the inspiration for _underscores.shop_s [tv_wall_mapper](https://github.com/cyberboy666/tv_wall_mapper/) application
