## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

during [CAMP ALOWHUM](https://www.alowhum.com/) festival 2024 i collaborated with the sydney based based noise band [PLEASURE](https://pleasure.bandcamp.com/album/pleasure) to do __crt countdown visuals__ for their 3 hour endurance set. we had a number of crt tvs set up around the band (with audience around them) displaying the countdown until end of set. this was a fun and unique experience - i only wish i got to document it more - but such is the way of festivals !
