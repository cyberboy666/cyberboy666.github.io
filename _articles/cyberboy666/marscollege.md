spent some time with Guergana ( [ichi_raramuri](https://www.instagram.com/ichi_raramuri/) ) in residency at [mars.college](https://mars.college/) - a educational program, R&D lab, and residential community dedicated to cultivating a low-cost, high-tech lifestyle in the california dessert.

although our scheduled soldering workshop was cancelled due to sandstorm+power outage, i did get to give a talk and demo about video-art ( _intro to video-art making instruments_ ) and perform with new friends including [phillip](https://phillipstearns.com/) and [kyoka](https://www.instagram.com/kyoka.sound/)
