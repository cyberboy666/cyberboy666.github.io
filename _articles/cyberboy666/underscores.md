i had been working towards this launch for almost 2 years and it was getting to the point where i was embarrassed at how long it was taking - my original plan was to launch about a year earlier starting with 3 products and adding to them from there. other life things got in the way (including needing to return to berlin to handover my apartment there) and so it was delayed - i did end up polishing up anohter 5 products in the meantime so we launched with a total of 8!
