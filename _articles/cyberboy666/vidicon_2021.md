## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

[Vidicon](https://vidicon.org/) is a gathering of video artists, analog, digital, software, hardware and everything in between. For 3-4 days there is never ending sessions of jams, talks, workshops, impromptu art pieces, collaborations and performances.

 once again [scanlines.xyz](https://scanlines.xyz) is providing infrastructure to help power this festival on independent and open-source technology - its been a pleasure to help make this event happen again this year

big ups to [autr](https://instagram.com/autr.tv) for coding the frontend for our multi-stage cube interface! and [ed](https://www.instagram.com/edwerk/) as always for bringing us all together
