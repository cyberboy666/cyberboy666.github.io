Matt McKegg (DWS) and i have performed improvised live a/v sets together on a number of occasions. Matt performs electronic music using open-source javascript software he created called [loopdrop]. we have similar approaches/interests in improvising, diy, hardware etc which makes collaborating a pleasure
