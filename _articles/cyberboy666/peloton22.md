Spent an amazing four days with the PELOTON crew - two days of cycling through swiss country side only to arrive at an old quarry and proceed with two days of partying with the new friends you made on route  

I lost any photos i may have taken during this time - heres one gilbert took of me near the start of our ride tho:
