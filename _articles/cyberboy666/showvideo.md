## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

most of this year my focus has been on toolmaking (see [r_e_c_u_r]({{site.url}}/recur) ) and travelling (without video gear), so not too much time for composing new video-art. i decided to concentrate my efforts on a series of commissioned music videos for some friends. This is the first, made with from DWS, (my longest collaborator) to coincide with his new EP [Digital Devices].
