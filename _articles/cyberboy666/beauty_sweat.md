another cool thing that happened this winter was the debut of PARTY_CONTROL my new interactive art / play installation for [@josiahliston](https://instagram.com/@josiahliston) immersive a/v spectacle BEAUTY/SWEAT - putting the punters in control of the video (so i could slack off &enjoy the party) the installation took live feed from a digital OHP (soft toys and assorted trinkets courtesy of [@vdraggy1](https://instagram.com/@vdraggy1) ) and processed it with custom raspberry-pi video effects via the handmade control panel (the magic, as usual is video-feedback!) - this feed is then routed through a korg entrancer ( a marvel and personal inspiration for intuitive and playful interface design ) giving up to 3 stations for hands-on interaction with the video-art collectively being created... this proved to be a huge success - throughout the 12 hours (and various stages of sentience) the installation was always in use and required no intervention or explanation from me - people happily exploring its depths and sharing new discoveries w friends and strangers. everything about the night, including the amazing djs, sound and venue, guerrilla projections onto the neighboring building, the UV art and fucktonne of blacklight was perfect - huge thanks to everyone involved !
