## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

I was commissioned to design some custom hardware for [Delainy Jamahl](https://www.instagram.com/delainy_jamahl/) from [Artifical Imagination](https://www.artificial.co.nz/)'s interactive art exhibit [__Sight Unseen__](https://www.thegridartspace.co.nz/sight-unseen) at Te Auaha Gallery. 

the piece involved tv's that slide along a rail with the art displayed reacting to the movement of the tv's. i designed a circuit that could read the changing voltage from a Displacement Sensor and converted this into a measurement sent via OSC on an ethernet network to a computer running touch designer which generates the video on screen.
