---

## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

[Vidicon](https://vidicon.org/) is a gathering of video artists, analog, digital, software, hardware and everything in between. For 3-4 days there is never ending sessions of jams, talks, workshops, impromptu art pieces, collaborations and performances.

i presented a talk - introducing [underscores.shop](https://underscores.shop) - an exclusive look into a project i have been working towards launching for some months now

the talk is about my plans to open a shop to sell some circuits, but also covers some history of open source, some personal experiences with video instruments and a fair bit of insufferable rambling about art, money and life ðŸ™Š
