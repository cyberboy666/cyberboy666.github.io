i presented a talk - introducing [underscores.shop](https://underscores.shop) - an exclusive look into a project i have been working towards launching for some months now

the talk is about my plans to open a shop to sell some circuits, but also covers some history of open source, some personal experiences with video instruments and a fair bit of insufferable rambling about art, money and life ðŸ™Š
