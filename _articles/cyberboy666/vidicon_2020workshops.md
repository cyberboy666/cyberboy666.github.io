[Vidicon](https://vidicon.org/) is a gathering of video artists, analog, digital, software, hardware and everything in between. For 3-4 days there is never ending sessions of jams, talks, workshops, impromptu art pieces, collaborations and performances.

I used this oppertunity to debut two different (online) video-art related workshops: 

the first was a mail-in video circuit building workshop around the _two_comparator_effect_ circuit i have been adapting - _two_comparator_effect DIY with cyberboy666 - The Comparator circuit is a Posterization video effect that produces high contrast video and differentiation. The circuit is based off a circuit design by Rob Schafer and made into an open source DIY project by cyberboy666 and the Scanlines community._

the second workshop was teaching about __kicad__ the open source pcb routing software - _Intro to KiCad: A hands on interactive workshop with cyberboy666 : Learn how to design and create printed circuit boards using the free and open source program Kicad. No prior experience needed! rsvp required as space is limited._
