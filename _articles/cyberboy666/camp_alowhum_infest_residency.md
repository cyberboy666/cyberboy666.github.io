[CAMP ALOWHUM](https://www.alowhum.com/) is an infamous underground music festival in New Zealand that ran through the 2000s and into 2010s. it had a reunion festival 10 years after the last time this happened over two sold-out weekends. between the festival weekends they had INFEST - a week of time for the bands attending to hang out, play and record music together and make art. [@4e.v.a](https://www.instagram.com/4e.v.a/) and i ran a pop-up __experimental media lab__ with a bunch of video equipment and instruments for _infest_ attendies to use. during this time we worked on effects for a number of music videos, promo content and doco footage as well as running daily workshops including:

- __Intro to video instruments__ - some analog and digital examples
- __Glitch art and Live video bending__
- __Making art with MICROSCOPES__ - plus liquids, prisms and nature w [@perescope_nz](https://www.instagram.com/perescope_nz/)
