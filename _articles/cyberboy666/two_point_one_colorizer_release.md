### two_point_one_colorizer

_an analog video colorizer effect - adapted from a rob schafer design_

Rob Schafer designed the original version of this circuit and shared it online in 2020.

It was updated and adapted to pcb by cyberboy666 as open-source hardware with help from the scanlines community â€“ changes included adding PAL, extra color controls and switching to parts that are cheaper & more available

now it can purchased from [underscores.shop/two_point_one_colorizer](underscores.shop/two_point_one_colorizer) or built from [source](https://github.com/cyberboy666/two_point_one_colorizer)
