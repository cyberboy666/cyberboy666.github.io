## [ {{page.title}} ]({{page.url}})

in the wake of physical isolation from first covid lockdowns some friends ( [Paloma Kop](https://palomakop.tv/), [Andrei Jay](https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/) and [Olivia Jack](https://ojack.xyz/ )) and i created an online community space to discuss diy video and audio projects, electronic-based art, and related interests. It is hosted on our own servers, running open source technology and intended as a refuge from large corporate social media sites. you can check it at [scanlines.xyz](https://scanlines.xyz)

in addition to the (discourse) forum we also set up a [chatroom](chat.scanlines.xyz), [streaming server](https://stream.scanlines.xyz/) and [video hosting platform](https://videos.scanlines.xyz/) for this community
