Courteney Lomas and i thought it would be fun to put on an event in her backyard to share the various art/music projects our friends are involved in. turns out it was.

in such a relaxed and supportive environment it was nice to experiment with ideas i had never tried live before. Catherine and i put together a noise set to open the basement stage. my visual set with Henry was the first time performing with live liquids, and my MX50 mixer got his first live outing performing with Matt.

a [playlist] of full sets from the basement can be viewed thanks to Matts gopro
