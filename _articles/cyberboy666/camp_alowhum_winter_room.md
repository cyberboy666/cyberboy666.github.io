during [CAMP ALOWHUM](https://www.alowhum.com/) festival 2024 i collaborated Erika ( [ladylazerlight](https://www.instagram.com/ladylazerlight/) ) to decorate the __Winter Room__ - _a stage converted from a hiking hut high in the hills above the festival ground_ - each night we had a different light installation - involving projections, addressable led strips, crt tvs, flood lights and mylar strips..

heres a few pics of how it looked on some of the nights:
