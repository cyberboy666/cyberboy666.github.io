### an interactive six part online course with cyberboy666

i taught another round of this [6 week online course](https://polyphaseportal.xyz/a-few-foundations-of-analog-video-on-breadboard/) about making video-art with electronics hosted by [Polyphase Portal](/_pages/polyphaseportal.md).

i made some iterations on the vga interface design and some of the modules based on how the last session went. besides a small hitch with positive vs negative hsync which we sorted everything went very smoothly and is feeling quite polished now. im looking forward to running this class again next winter (plus maybe planning for a new one?)
