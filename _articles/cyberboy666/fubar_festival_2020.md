fu:bar is the longest running glitch-art fesival - a celebration of errors in Zagreb, Croatia, that aims to gather contemporary glitch artists from all around the globe. This year the festival was held completely online - including inside an interactive 3d render of the medika cultural centre.

My new video piece _~ gezeiten ~_ (a collaboration with berlin based producer [alec budd](https://www.instagram.com/alecbudd/) ) premiered at this festival. both as an installation in the virtual gallery and as part of their short and experimental online film screening.

I also gave a lecture about the joys and struggles of performing with real-time analog video corruption and a live demo of a new video-circuit SYNC_OPE i have been working on with Gael Jaton.
