i am going to try following this [project]

![bench power](./images/benchpower.jpg)

these are some of the parts i might need :

PART | NOTE | cost (usd) | in stock
 --- | --- | --- | ---
Step Down Transformer (24V, 3A) | i couldnt find this from ali so will have to get from [jaycar] |34nzd | no - need to get from jaycar
DIY Power Supply Kit | from ali | 4.74 | yes
Heat Sink and Fan | from ali | 2.47 | yes
Volt-Amp Panel Meter | from ali | 2.57 | yes
Potentiometer Knob | i have these | n/a | yes
Buck Converter | not sure if i will want this | n/a | n/a
USB Port | same as above | n/a | n/a
Binding Post Banana Plug | ~i might have these / want a different plug~ decided to stick with ali | 1.46 | yes
IEC3 Power Socket | from ali | .89 | no

in total these parts (including quite a few extra parts for the backlog) comes to : ~18 usd -> ~27 nzd + transformer for 34nzd bringing total for project to around **$60**

## next step:

the parts are ordered - i look forward to putting it together once they arrive. note: completing this is blocking work on the [x0xb0x] synth as i will want to use it while making that kit.

i can still work on the encloser before then though

### 28/3 UPDATE

most of the parts have arrived. just need the encloser printed and to buy the transformer from jaycar. i have soldered together the circuit from the kit. just need to put everything together now (once the case and final parts are ready)
