## what you will need

![2][2]

list of components used in this project:

- 1k ohm linear potentiometer (links?)
- x3 rca jacks
- some wire
- a casing (I used a cassette box)

note: you will also need some basic tools to get started - see this list of recommended tools.

![1][1]

## the schematic

![picture of the schematic][schematic]

this is one of the simplest circuits you can make with analogue video signals. It takes the positive signals from the two inputs and sends it to the potentiometer to be 'mixed'. The positive output signal is a combination of the two inputs based on the position of the pot (hard left is all input1, hard right all input2). When the output is mixed sync on one input is lost resulting in the scrolling effect.

## Assembling the circuit

1. carefully drill holes in your casing and screw in the components (I started with small holes first to avoid cracking the case)
![3][3]
2. wire all the grounds together and the signals to the pot as per the schematic (obviously colour choice is arbitrary but it helps to be consistent - especially with more complex builds)

3. test it out! (you will need two source composite video signals to use this device - see here for some beginner video source ideas.)

results also vary depending on your choice of display - save a CRT!)

## afterthoughts

- ~~try feeding an audio signal into one of the inputs~~ - ~~what out the output back into input?~~
- did it work? did you spot a mistake or know a good improvement to this build? please get in touch here and let me know.
