# diy guide to starting eurorack

## motive

as a hobbyist diy-er/maker interested in electronic video and audio tools, i want to learn about designing things for the eurorack modular standard. i will try to document my progress, research and projects here so other people interested in designing , creating , modifing or converting gear for eurorack can use this research:

## chapter ideas:

- overview of the eurorack standand : size , power supply , jacks , communication etc
- diy case building ideas (buying racks, using plywood, 3d printing, converting suitcase...)
- diy power supplying ideas (salvaged switching, diy linear stepdown, modify ac wallwart, measuring current draw)
- diy power distribution 
- creating panels (3d print , laser cut , labeling w vinyl? sticker paper , etching etc )
- triggering animal farm toy
- gate triggering basics
- euro cv levels and convertion / protection measures
- some basic effect circuits
- modifed volca beats w/ breakout
- power stepdown for modified gear
- audio line level adjustment for modified gear
- 3d printed custom case for standalone use of euro module
- midi splitter (3.5jack for carring midi)
- research / notes around open source hardware, licencing , etiquette
- arduino based modules : basic sequencer / sampler ?
- building existing module projects (pcb printing / ordering , part sourcing etc)
- converting dr110 drum machine to euro
- ? some kind of modified cassette player ?

### video circuits

- basics (tbc etc)
- dirty mixer
- sync stripper circuit
- vga synth + extentions/crossover
- modified fluxus circuit
- building diy lzx
- interactions with 3trins / equations / vidiot?
- mods for controlling video gear (switching , adding cv control , midi)
