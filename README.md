# langolierz.github.io

second attempt to create this webpage. mainly the index page has been redesigned, also the overall tone. the list below still applies though.

Things to do:
- [ ] write content! [tim]
- [ ] use sass imports
- [ ] use sass vaiables (for example - changing the banner height also changes the title posision to match)
- [ ] change background colours
- [ ] move some config links to a data file (picture paths etc)
- [ ] add metadata and good keywords /(tags?) to make the articles more search-engine discoverable [tim]
- [ ] set up custom domain name [tim]
- [ ] leave comments on code to make it more readable
